        <p> <strong> G8 </strong> <br>
            &#160;The base G8, referred to in Pontiac sales literature as the "G8 Sedan", is available with a 3.6-liter High Feature V6 engine, producing 256 hp (191 kW). The only transmission available is a five-speed GM 5L40-E automatic; fuel economy is officially rated at 17 mpg‑US (14 L/100 km) city/25 mpg‑US (9.4 L/100 km) highway.[13]

            &#160;Base G8 models come standard with six airbags (including full-length side curtain airbags), traction control, electronic stability control, dual tailpipes, 18-inch alloy wheels (fitted with either all-season or summer performance tires), sports body kit, fog lights, power windows and locks, cruise control, black cloth seats and a seven-speaker audio system, including front center speaker, single-disc CD player, and auxiliary input jack.[14]

            &#160;A "Comfort And Sound" package is available on V6 powered G8s, which upgrades the seven-speaker audio system and manual HVAC controls to the 11-speaker audio and automatic climate control found in the GT model. The "Premium" package upgrades the Sedan's cloth seats to leather seating surfaces, driver and passenger heated seats, six-way power driver seat adjuster, 6-way power front-passenger seat adjuster, rear center armrest, leather-wrapped shift lever, and the GT's standard leather-wrapped steering wheel. Both the base G8 and the GT utilize the "FE2" suspension package.
        </p>
        <p> <p> <strong> GT </strong> <br>
            &#160;The GT comes with a 361 hp (269 kW)[15] 6.0 L (364 cu in) Generation IV V8,[13] featuring a 6-speed 6L80 automatic and Active Fuel Management, capable of reaching 60 mph (97 km/h) in 5.3 seconds,[16] with quarter-mile times as low as 13.8 seconds.[16] The G8 GT averages a fuel economy of 15/24 mpg (city/highway). A 6-speed manual was being considered as an option on the GT model, but Pontiac decided against offering it, stating that it would instead be offered as an option on the G8 GXP. One change in 2009 was the deletion of the center stack oil pressure and voltage gauges. Midway through the 2009 model year a few changes were made to the G8 GT, including an additional pair of catalytic converters which reduced engine output to 355 hp (265 kW), the addition of bluetooth and the removal of the rear cup holders that pulled out from under the rear seats (cupholders in the fold-down rear center armrest took their place).

            &#160;In addition to the larger engine and six-speed transmission, GT models also contain additional equipment, including all of the standard Sedan features plus quad tailpipes, clear taillight lenses (as opposed to the Sedan's traditional red taillights), automatic dual-zone air conditioning, a larger center-console display screen, and an 11-speaker Blaupunkt premium audio system with 2 subwoofers, six-disc CD changer, and auxiliary input jack.[14] Some (but not all) of these features are available as options on the base model. A sports package is available on the GT, adding sport metallic pedals, QS4 19" machine-faced aluminum wheels, summer performance tires and a slightly smaller diameter, leather-wrapped Sport steering wheel.

        <p> <p> <strong> GXP </strong> <br>
            &#160;A G8 GXP version was shown at the New York International Auto Show in March 2008 with a 6.2-liter[13]402 hp (300 kW) V8 from the Chevrolet Corvette and a six-speed manual transmission.[17] The production version of the GXP was more powerful with its LS3 V8 producing 415 hp (309 kW) and 415 lb·ft (563 N·m) of torque. Both the six-speed Tremec TR-6060 manual transmission and the six-speed automatic transmission were available. The GXP reached 60 mph (97 km/h) from a standstill in 4.5 seconds, a quarter-mile time of 13.0 seconds at 109.6 mph (176.4 km/h), and 0.90g (8.8 m/s2) of lateral acceleration on a skidpad.[18]

            &#160;The GXP has an upgraded, Nürburgring-tuned FE3 suspension package, as well as larger, ventilated Brembo disc brakes. It also features a unique front bumper cover and a rear (non-functional) diffuser to differentiate it from the standard Sedan and GT models.

            &#160;Total sales of the Pontiac G8 GXP were 1,829 units.[19] Only a limited production of 6 G8 GXP were available in Canada.

            &#160;In 2014, General Motors released the Chevrolet SS, which was in essence the next generation of the G8 GXP. It was based on the new VF chassis Holden Commodore, the successor to the VE chassis Commodore on which the G8 was based.[20] Both the G8 GXP and the SS shared the same LS3 V8 engine, with the new SS sporting the engine with minor improvements. Horsepower for both remained 415, with 415 lb. ft. of torque.
